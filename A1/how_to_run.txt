$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

So in the same folder as your .c file to compile, run the following command
$ make

If successful (ie gcc didn't complain) you should now have a file name Assignment_1 (with no file extension)

Try running
$./Assignment_1
and see what happens. It should fail with an appropriate error message as this assignment requires an input file from the command line

To run it properly use
$./Assignment_1 sample_in.txt
